	Use:   "biz",
	Short: "A fast, minimal JavaScript package manager",
	Long: `Biz üêº is a lightweight JavaScript package manager developed in Go and designed to simplify 
dependency management for your projects. With Biz, you can quickly add, remove, 
and manage packages, while keeping your project manifest and lockfile up to date.

Features include:
  - Fast installation of packages from the npm registry
  - Automatic dependency resolution and lockfile updates
  - Support for development and production dependencies
  - Easy-to-use CLI commands like 'add', 'remove', and 'install'

Usage Examples:

  # Initialize a new project
  biz init

  # Add a package to your dependencies
  biz get lodash

  # Remove a package from your project
  biz remove lodash

  # Install all dependencies listed in the manifest
  biz install

Biz empowers developers to manage dependencies efficiently without the overhead 
of larger package managers, making project setup and maintenance faster and simpler.`,
